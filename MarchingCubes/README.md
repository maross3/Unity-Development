# Network Synched Marching Cube algorithm

Features:
* An algorithm that can create 3D objects from a series of fMRI image stacks.
* GPU forwarded Marching Cubes
* Authoritative synchronization of meshes computed from a compute shader (GPU driven instructions) using Pun2


Todos:
* Use neon gate to synch the clients
* fMRI image prossessing algorthim needs to be forwarded to the gpu using compute shaders
