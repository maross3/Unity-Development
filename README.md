### Object pool

* Speed up prototyping and production with an easy-to-use object pool, designed with extensibility in mind.
* Includes a looting system!

### OVR controller
 
* To release an application to the Oculus Store, your game must not drop below 60 frames at any point during application reviews.
*  Stay above the pesky 60 frames per second limit on the Oculus Quest 2!
* This is a barebones solution with extensibility and maintenance reduction. Utilizes state patterns and an observer pattern. 

### Shader Central

* The way a game looks is just as important as how fun it is. Giving your application it's own artstyle can make the difference between a robust experience and disappointing one.
* Difficulties while navigating technichal constraints is always at the top of priorities. These shaders will perform when you need it the most!
