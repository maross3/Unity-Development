# Quirky spline engine for wire/line like compontents.

Important: Click on add physics button whenever you start the Spline Scene, on the Spline Engine Object. Hacky, so sue me.

This spline engine is programmed so that you can add or remove any number of components to each of the spline nodes, or points. This enables us to easily and rapidly create physics like the demo scene. The sky is the limit with this one.
