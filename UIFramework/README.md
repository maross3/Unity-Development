# Procedurally Generated UI-Framework.

Will add more controls later.

Functionality is there. Now to design it into something that feels more like winforms.
Drive: I can code UI like I can in WinForms, but in unity. How OP is that?

Needs an editor like WinForms too. Todo, format all images and readmes in this whole repo lol
